# School-Management-Sysment
The School Management System is a web application built with Java, JSP, Servlets, and MySQL to streamline essential school operations, such as managing student and teacher
records, tracking attendance, and recording grades. The applicationâ€™s front end uses JSP with HTML to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for administrators and faculty, featuring forms for data entry and a dashboard for seamless navigation. In the backend, Java Servlets manage the core business logic, processing
user requests and interacting with the MySQL database to retrieve and store information. MySQL serves as the central database, housing all records related to students, teachers, classes, attendance, and grades. Key features include session management for secure user authentication, restricting access to authorized users only. By consolidating essential school data and automating administrative workflows, this system reduces redundancy and provides real-time access to records, enhancing decision-making and operational efficiency.
